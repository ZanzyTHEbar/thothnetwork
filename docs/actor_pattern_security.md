## Authentication and Authorization

The system uses a comprehensive authentication and authorization framework to control access to resources and operations.

### Authentication

Authentication verifies the identity of users, devices, and services. The system supports multiple authentication methods:

1. **API Key Authentication**: For service-to-service communication.
2. **JWT Authentication**: For user authentication with web and mobile clients.
3. **Certificate Authentication**: For device authentication.
4. **OAuth 2.0**: For integration with external identity providers.

### Authorization

Authorization controls what authenticated entities can do. The system uses role-based access control (RBAC) with the following components:

1. **Roles**: Predefined sets of permissions (e.g., Admin, Operator, User, Device).
2. **Permissions**: Fine-grained access controls for specific operations (e.g., read, write, execute).
3. **Policies**: Rules that determine when permissions are granted or denied.
4. **Scopes**: Limitations on the resources that can be accessed (e.g., specific devices, rooms, or organizations).

### Authentication and Authorization Flow

The following diagram illustrates the authentication and authorization flow:

```mermaid

    participant Client
    participant API
    participant Auth
    participant TokenService
    participant RBAC
    participant ActorSystem
    
    Client->>API: Request with Credentials
    API->>Auth: Authenticate
    Auth->>TokenService: Generate Token
    TokenService-->>Auth: JWT Token
    Auth-->>API: JWT Token
    API-->>Client: JWT Token
    
    Client->>API: Request with JWT
    API->>Auth: Validate Token
    Auth->>TokenService: Verify Token
    TokenService-->>Auth: Token Valid
    Auth->>RBAC: Check Permissions
    RBAC-->>Auth: Permissions Granted
    Auth-->>API: Authorization Granted
    API->>ActorSystem: Authorized Request
    ActorSystem-->>API: Response
    API-->>Client: Response
```

## Data Protection

The system implements multiple layers of data protection to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.

### Data Classification

Data is classified based on sensitivity:

1. **Public Data**: Information that can be freely shared (e.g., device types, public room names).
2. **Internal Data**: Information that should be restricted to authorized users (e.g., device telemetry, room configurations).
3. **Sensitive Data**: Information that requires special protection (e.g., user credentials, device credentials).
4. **Critical Data**: Information that is essential for system operation and security (e.g., encryption keys, security configurations).

### Data Protection Flow

The following diagram illustrates the data protection flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API
    participant Auth
    participant ActorSystem
    participant DeviceActor
    participant DataStore
    
    Client->>API: Request with Credentials
    API->>Auth: Authenticate
    Auth-->>API: JWT Token
    
    Client->>API: Request with JWT
    API->>Auth: Validate Token
    Auth-->>API: Token Valid + Permissions
    
    API->>ActorSystem: Authorized Request
    ActorSystem->>DeviceActor: Process Request
    
    alt Sensitive Data
        DeviceActor->>DeviceActor: Encrypt Sensitive Fields
    end
    
    DeviceActor->>DataStore: Store Data
    DataStore-->>DeviceActor: Confirmation
    DeviceActor-->>ActorSystem: Response
    ActorSystem-->>API: Response
    API-->>Client: Response
```

### Encryption

The system uses encryption to protect data:

1. **Transport Encryption**: All network communication is encrypted using TLS.
2. **Message Encryption**: Sensitive message payloads are encrypted using symmetric encryption.
3. **Storage Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted before being stored in databases.
4. **Key Management**: Encryption keys are securely managed using a key management service.

## Network Security

The system implements multiple layers of network security to protect against unauthorized access and attacks.

### Network Security Layers

1. **Firewalls**: Control inbound and outbound network traffic based on security rules.
2. **Network Segmentation**: Divide the network into segments with different security requirements.
3. **VPN**: Provide secure remote access to the system.
4. **DDoS Protection**: Protect against distributed denial-of-service attacks.
5. **Intrusion Detection/Prevention**: Detect and prevent network intrusions.

### Network Security Architecture

        Monitoring["Monitoring"]
        Logging["Logging"]
    end
    
    AS --> Monitoring
    AS --> Logging
```

## Device Security

Securing IoT devices is a critical aspect of the overall security architecture.

### Device Security Measures

1. **Device Authentication**: Devices authenticate using certificates or pre-shared keys.
2. **Secure Boot**: Devices verify the integrity of their firmware during boot.
3. **Secure Updates**: Device firmware is updated securely using signed updates.
4. **Device Isolation**: Devices are isolated from each other to prevent lateral movement.
5. **Monitoring**: Device behavior is monitored for anomalies that might indicate compromise.

### Device Authentication Flow

    MQTT->>Auth: Validate Certificate
    Auth-->>MQTT: Certificate Valid
    MQTT-->>Device: Connection Established
    
    Device->>MQTT: Publish Message
    MQTT->>Auth: Check Permissions
    Auth-->>MQTT: Permissions Granted
    MQTT->>ActorSystem: Forward Message
    ActorSystem->>DeviceActor: Process Message
    DeviceActor-->>ActorSystem: Response
    ActorSystem->>MQTT: Forward Response
    MQTT->>Device: Deliver Response
```

## Threat Modeling

The system uses threat modeling to identify and mitigate potential security threats.

### STRIDE Threat Model

The STRIDE model is used to categorize threats:

1. **Spoofing**: Impersonating another user or device.
   - Mitigation: Strong authentication mechanisms, including certificates and multi-factor authentication.

2. **Tampering**: Modifying data without authorization.
   - Mitigation: Data integrity checks, digital signatures, and access controls.

3. **Repudiation**: Denying having performed an action.
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive logging and audit trails.

4. **Information Disclosure**: Exposing information to unauthorized parties.
   - Mitigation: Encryption, access controls, and data classification.

5. **Denial of Service**: Preventing legitimate users from accessing the system.
   - Mitigation: Rate limiting, resource quotas, and DDoS protection.

6. **Elevation of Privilege**: Gaining higher privileges than authorized.
   - Mitigation: Principle of least privilege, role-based access control, and regular permission reviews.

### Attack Surface Analysis

The system's attack surface is analyzed to identify potential vulnerabilities:

1. **Network Interfaces**: APIs, message brokers, and other network services.
2. **User Interfaces**: Web interfaces, mobile apps, and command-line tools.
3. **Device Interfaces**: Physical and network interfaces on IoT devices.
4. **Data Storage**: Databases, file systems, and caches.

## Example: Securing Actor Communication

The following example shows how to secure communication between actors:

```go
// Configure TLS for actor system
tlsConfig := &tls.Config{
    Certificates:       []tls.Certificate{cert},
    RootCAs:            rootCAs,
    InsecureSkipVerify: false,
    MinVersion:         tls.VersionTLS12,
    CipherSuites:       []uint16{
        tls.TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
        tls.TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
    },
}

// Configure actor system with TLS
config := actor.Config{
    Address:     "192.168.1.1",
    Port:        8000,
    ClusterName: "iot-cluster",
    TLSConfig:   tlsConfig,
}

// Create actor system with security middleware
actorSystem := actor.NewActorSystem(config, logger)

// Add authentication middleware
actorSystem.Use(func(next actor.ReceiverFunc) actor.ReceiverFunc {
    return func(ctx actor.Context) {
        // Authenticate the message sender
        if !authenticate(ctx.Sender(), ctx.Message()) {
            ctx.Respond(errors.New("authentication failed"))
            return
        }
        next(ctx)
    }
})

// Add authorization middleware
actorSystem.Use(func(next actor.ReceiverFunc) actor.ReceiverFunc {
    return func(ctx actor.Context) {
        // Authorize the message sender for the requested operation
        if !authorize(ctx.Sender(), ctx.Self(), ctx.Message()) {
            ctx.Respond(errors.New("authorization failed"))
            return
        }
        next(ctx)
    }
})

// Add encryption middleware
actorSystem.Use(func(next actor.ReceiverFunc) actor.ReceiverFunc {
    return func(ctx actor.Context) {
        // Decrypt the message if it's encrypted
        if msg, ok := ctx.Message().(*message.Message); ok && msg.Encrypted {
            decryptedPayload, err := decrypt(msg.Payload, getKey(ctx.Sender()))
            if err != nil {
                ctx.Respond(err)
                return
            }
            msg.Payload = decryptedPayload
            msg.Encrypted = false
        }
        next(ctx)
    }
})
```

## Conclusion

Security is a critical aspect of the actor-based IoT system. By implementing a comprehensive security architecture that addresses authentication, authorization, data protection, network security, and other security concerns, the system can protect against a wide range of threats while providing the required functionality and performance.
