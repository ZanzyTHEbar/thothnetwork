# Actor Pattern Implementation in IoT System

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of the actor pattern implementation in the IoT system using the `go-hollywood` package. The actor pattern is a concurrency model that treats actors as the universal primitives of concurrent computation. In our IoT system, actors represent devices, digital twins, rooms, and processing pipelines, enabling a scalable and fault-tolerant architecture.
