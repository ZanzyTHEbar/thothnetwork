## Code Review Findings

### Critical Issues

1. **Race Conditions in Actor Service**

   The `Service` struct in `internal/services/actor/actor_service.go` contains maps (`deviceActors` and `roomActors`) that are accessed concurrently without proper synchronization:

   ```go
   // Service provides actor management functionality
   type Service struct {
       actorSystem  *actorpkg.ActorSystem
       deviceRepo   repositories.DeviceRepository
       roomRepo     repositories.RoomRepository
       deviceActors map[string]*actor.PID
       roomActors   map[string]*actor.PID
       logger       logger.Logger
   }
   ```

   These maps are accessed in methods like `StartDeviceActor`, `StopDeviceActor`, `SendMessageToDevice`, etc., without proper locking, which could lead to race conditions.

   **Recommendation**: Add a mutex to the `Service` struct and use it to protect access to the maps:

   ```go
   type Service struct {
       actorSystem  *actorpkg.ActorSystem
       deviceRepo   repositories.DeviceRepository
       roomRepo     repositories.RoomRepository
       deviceActors map[string]*actor.PID
       roomActors   map[string]*actor.PID
       logger       logger.Logger
       mu           sync.RWMutex
   }
   ```

   Then use the mutex in all methods that access the maps:

   ```go
   func (s *Service) StartDeviceActor(ctx context.Context, deviceID string) error {
       // ...
       s.mu.Lock()
       defer s.mu.Unlock()
       
       if _, exists := s.deviceActors[deviceID]; exists {
           // ...
       }
       
       // ...
       s.deviceActors[deviceID] = pid
       // ...
   }
   ```

2. **Lack of Supervision Strategies**

   The actor system does not implement explicit supervision strategies for handling actor failures. When an actor fails, there's no defined mechanism for restarting it or handling the failure.

   **Recommendation**: Implement supervision strategies for different actor types:

   ```go
   // Create supervisor for device actors
   deviceSupervisor := actor.NewSupervisor(
       actor.SupervisorConfig{
           Strategy: actor.OneForOneStrategy,
           MaxRetries: 10,
           WithinDuration: 1 * time.Minute,
       },
   )
   
   // Create device actor with supervisor
   props := actor.PropsFromProducer(func() actor.Receiver {
       return NewDeviceActor(deviceID, s.logger)
   }).WithSupervisor(deviceSupervisor)
   ```

3. **Inefficient Room Device Management**

   The `Room` struct in `internal/core/room/room.go` uses a linear search for adding and removing devices:

   ```go
   // AddDevice adds a device to the room
   func (r *Room) AddDevice(deviceID string) bool {
       // Check if device is already in the room
       // TODO: Optimize this
       for _, id := range r.Devices {
           if id == deviceID {
               return false
           }
       }
       
       // Add device to the room
       r.Devices = append(r.Devices, deviceID)
       r.UpdatedAt = time.Now()
       return true
   }
   ```

   This is inefficient for rooms with many devices.

   **Recommendation**: Use a map for O(1) lookups:

   ```go
   type Room struct {
       // ...
       Devices    []string                `json:"devices"`
       deviceMap  map[string]struct{}     // For O(1) lookups
       // ...
   }
   
   func (r *Room) AddDevice(deviceID string) bool {
       if r.deviceMap == nil {
           r.deviceMap = make(map[string]struct{})
           for _, id := range r.Devices {
               r.deviceMap[id] = struct{}{}
           }
       }
       
       if _, exists := r.deviceMap[deviceID]; exists {
           return false
       }
       
       r.Devices = append(r.Devices, deviceID)
       r.deviceMap[deviceID] = struct{}{}
       r.UpdatedAt = time.Now()
       return true
   }
   ```

### Major Issues

1. **Limited Error Recovery in Actors**

   The actor implementation does not include comprehensive error recovery mechanisms. When an actor encounters an error, there's limited logic for recovering and continuing operation.

   **Recommendation**: Implement a more robust error handling strategy in actors:

   ```go
   func (a *DeviceActor) handleMessage(ctx actor.Context, msg *message.Message) {
       defer func() {
           if r := recover(); r != nil {
               a.logger.Error("Panic in message handling", "panic", r)
               // Report error to supervisor
               ctx.Poison(ctx.Self())
           }
       }()
       
       // Process message...
   }
   ```

2. **No Actor Passivation**

   The actor system does not implement passivation for inactive actors, which could lead to resource exhaustion with many actors.

   **Recommendation**: Implement actor passivation for inactive actors:

   ```go
   func (a *DeviceActor) Receive(ctx actor.Context) {
       switch msg := ctx.Message().(type) {
       // ...
       case *actor.ReceiveTimeout:
           a.handlePassivation(ctx)
       // ...
       }
   }
   
   func (a *DeviceActor) handlePassivation(ctx actor.Context) {
       a.logger.Info("Passivating actor due to inactivity")
       // Save state if needed
       ctx.Stop(ctx.Self())
   }
   ```

3. **Inconsistent Error Handling**

   Error handling is inconsistent across the codebase. Some functions return detailed errors with the `errbuilder` package, while others use generic errors or don't handle errors properly.

   **Recommendation**: Standardize error handling across the codebase:

   ```go
   // Instead of
   return fmt.Errorf("failed to process message: %w", err)
   
   // Use
   return errbuilder.NewErrBuilder().
       WithMsg("Failed to process message").
       WithCode(errbuilder.CodeInternal).
       WithCause(err)
   ```

### Minor Issues

1. **Limited Documentation for Some Components**

   While the overall documentation is comprehensive, some components lack detailed documentation, particularly around error handling and recovery mechanisms.

   **Recommendation**: Add comprehensive documentation for all components, especially around error handling and recovery.

2. **Inconsistent Logging**

   Logging is inconsistent across the codebase. Some components use structured logging with appropriate context, while others use minimal logging or inconsistent formats.

   **Recommendation**: Standardize logging across the codebase with consistent formats and context.

3. **Limited Use of Context**

   The `context.Context` parameter is not consistently used for cancellation and timeouts throughout the codebase.

   **Recommendation**: Use `context.Context` consistently for cancellation and timeouts in all operations.

## Performance Analysis

### Message Processing Performance

The current implementation processes messages sequentially within each actor, which is appropriate for the actor model. However, there are opportunities for optimization:

1. **Message Batching**: Implement message batching for high-throughput scenarios to reduce overhead.
2. **Custom Dispatchers**: Configure custom dispatchers for different actor types based on their workload characteristics.
3. **Mailbox Optimization**: Optimize mailbox sizes and processing strategies based on actor types and message patterns.

### Memory Usage

The implementation does not include explicit memory management for large actor state, which could lead to high memory usage with many actors:

1. **State Size Limits**: Implement size limits for actor state to prevent memory exhaustion.
2. **Passivation**: Implement passivation for inactive actors to free memory.
3. **Efficient Data Structures**: Use memory-efficient data structures for actor state.

### Concurrency

The actor model provides natural concurrency, but there are opportunities for optimization:

1. **Actor Sharding**: Implement consistent hashing for actor sharding to distribute load.
2. **Parallelism Control**: Configure appropriate parallelism levels for different actor types.

## Conclusion

The actor pattern implementation in the IoT system demonstrates a well-structured approach to using the actor model for device management. The code follows a clean hexagonal architecture with clear separation of concerns, and the actor system provides a solid foundation for handling concurrent operations and message passing.

However, there are several areas for improvement, particularly around concurrency safety, error handling, performance optimization, and test coverage. By addressing these issues, the system can become more robust, scalable, and maintainable.
