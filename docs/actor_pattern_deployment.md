```

### Container Components

1. **API Pods**: Host the REST and MQTT APIs that external clients use to interact with the system.
2. **Actor System Pods**: Host the actor system instances that manage device, room, and other actors.
3. **Database Pods**: Host the databases used for persistent storage of device state, room configurations, and other data.
4. **Message Broker Pods**: Host the NATS message broker instances used for communication between components.

### Kubernetes Resources

The system uses the following Kubernetes resources:

1. **Deployments**: Define the desired state for the pods, including the number of replicas, container images, and resource requirements.
2. **Services**: Provide stable network endpoints for accessing the pods.
3. **ConfigMaps**: Store configuration data that can be consumed by the pods.
4. **Secrets**: Store sensitive data such as API keys and credentials.
5. **StatefulSets**: Used for stateful components like databases that require stable network identities and persistent storage.
6. **PersistentVolumes**: Provide persistent storage for stateful components.
7. **HorizontalPodAutoscalers**: Automatically scale the number of pod replicas based on CPU utilization or custom metrics.

## Cloud Deployment

The system can be deployed in cloud environments, leveraging cloud-native services for improved reliability, scalability, and manageability. The following diagram illustrates the cloud deployment architecture:

        subgraph "Region 1"
            subgraph "Zone 1A"
                AS1["Actor System 1"]
                DB1["Database 1"]
            end
            
            subgraph "Zone 1B"
                AS2["Actor System 2"]
                DB2["Database 2"]

            subgraph "Zone 2B"
                AS4["Actor System 4"]
                DB4["Database 4"]
            end
        end
        
        GLB["Global Load Balancer"]
        CDN["Content Delivery Network"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Edge Locations"
        Edge1["Edge Location 1"]
        Edge2["Edge Location 2"]

## Edge Computing

For IoT scenarios with low-latency requirements or limited connectivity, the system can be deployed using an edge computing architecture. The following diagram illustrates this approach:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph "Cloud"
        CloudAS["Cloud Actor System"]
        CloudDB["Cloud Database"]
        CloudMB["Cloud Message Broker"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Edge Location 1"
        Edge1AS["Edge Actor System 1"]
        Edge1DB["Edge Database 1"]
        Edge1MB["Edge Message Broker 1"]
        
        subgraph "Devices 1"
            Device1A["Device 1A"]
            Device1B["Device 1B"]
            Device1N["Device 1N"]
        end
    end
    
    subgraph "Edge Location 2"
        Edge2AS["Edge Actor System 2"]
        Edge2DB["Edge Database 2"]
        Edge2MB["Edge Message Broker 2"]
        
        subgraph "Devices 2"
            Device2A["Device 2A"]
            Device2B["Device 2B"]
            Device2N["Device 2N"]
        end
    end
    
    Device1A <--> Edge1MB
    Device1B <--> Edge1MB
    Device1N <--> Edge1MB
    
    Device2A <--> Edge2MB
    Device2B <--> Edge2MB
    Device2N <--> Edge2MB
    
    Edge1MB <--> Edge1AS
    Edge2MB <--> Edge2AS
    
    Edge1AS <--> Edge1DB
    Edge2AS <--> Edge2DB
    
    Edge1AS <-->|"Sync"| CloudAS
    Edge2AS <-->|"Sync"| CloudAS
    
    Edge1DB <-->|"Sync"| CloudDB
    Edge2DB <-->|"Sync"| CloudDB
    
    Edge1MB <-->|"Sync"| CloudMB
    Edge2MB <-->|"Sync"| CloudMB
```

### Edge Components

1. **Edge Actor System**: A lightweight version of the actor system that runs on edge devices or gateways.
2. **Edge Database**: A local database for storing device state and other data at the edge.
3. **Edge Message Broker**: A local message broker for communication between components at the edge.

### Edge-Cloud Synchronization

The edge and cloud components synchronize data using the following mechanisms:

1. **State Synchronization**: Device and room state is synchronized between edge and cloud databases.
2. **Message Forwarding**: Messages that need to be processed in the cloud are forwarded from edge to cloud message brokers.
3. **Command Distribution**: Commands from the cloud are distributed to the appropriate edge locations.
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Conflicts between edge and cloud state are resolved using appropriate strategies (e.g., last-writer-wins, merge).

## Deployment Configurations

The system supports different deployment configurations based on the specific requirements of the deployment environment:

### Development Configuration

- Single-node deployment for development and testing
- In-memory databases for simplicity
- Local message broker
- Minimal resource requirements

### Testing Configuration

- Multi-node deployment for integration and performance testing
- Persistent databases with test data
- Distributed message broker
- Realistic resource allocation

### Production Configuration

- Fully distributed deployment across multiple zones and regions
- High-availability databases with replication
- Clustered message broker with redundancy
- Appropriate resource allocation based on expected load
- Monitoring, logging, and alerting enabled

## Deployment Process

The deployment process follows these steps:

1. **Build**: Build container images for all components.
2. **Test**: Run automated tests on the built images.
3. **Push**: Push the images to a container registry.
4. **Deploy**: Deploy the images to the target environment using Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts.
5. **Verify**: Verify the deployment by running health checks and smoke tests.
6. **Monitor**: Monitor the deployment for any issues.

## Infrastructure as Code

The deployment infrastructure is defined as code using tools like Terraform, Kubernetes YAML manifests, or Helm charts. This approach provides several benefits:

1. **Reproducibility**: Deployments can be reproduced consistently across environments.
2. **Version Control**: Infrastructure changes can be tracked in version control.
3. **Automation**: Deployments can be automated using CI/CD pipelines.
4. **Documentation**: The infrastructure is self-documenting through the code.

## Example: Kubernetes Deployment

The following example shows a Kubernetes deployment for an actor system pod:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: actor-system
  labels:
    app: actor-system
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: actor-system
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: actor-system
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: actor-system
        image: iot-system/actor-system:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000

          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: database-credentials
              key: url
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "500m"
            memory: "512Mi"
          limits:
            cpu: "2000m"
            memory: "2Gi"
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8000
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /ready
            port: 8000
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 5
```
