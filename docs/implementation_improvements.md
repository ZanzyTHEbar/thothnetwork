# Implementation Improvements

This document summarizes the improvements made to the codebase based on the technical audit findings.

## 1. Concurrent Hash Map for Thread-Safe Actor References

We implemented a thread-safe concurrent hash map to address race conditions in the actor service:

```go
// HashMap is a thread-safe concurrent hash map implementation
type HashMap struct {
    shards     []*mapShard
    shardCount int
    shardMask  int
}
```

The concurrent hash map uses sharding to reduce contention:
- Each shard has its own read-write mutex
- Keys are distributed across shards using a hash function
- Operations like Get, Put, and Remove are performed on the appropriate shard

This implementation provides:
- Thread-safe operations without global locks
- Better performance under concurrent access
- Reduced contention through sharding

## 2. Optimized Room Device Management

We improved the `Room` struct to use a map for O(1) lookups:

```go
// Room represents a logical grouping of devices
type Room struct {
    // ...
    Devices    []string            `json:"devices"`
    deviceMap  map[string]struct{} `json:"-"`
    // ...
}
```

The optimized implementation:
- Maintains a map for O(1) lookups
- Keeps the original slice for ordered access and serialization
- Lazy initializes the map when needed
- Uses `slices.Delete` for more efficient slice operations

## 3. Actor Passivation for Resource Management

We implemented actor passivation to free resources for inactive actors:

```go
// PassivationManager manages actor passivation
type PassivationManager struct {
    lastActivity map[string]time.Time
    timeout      time.Duration
    engine       *actor.Engine
    logger       logger.Logger
    mu           sync.RWMutex
}
```

The passivation manager:
- Tracks the last activity time for each actor
- Periodically checks for inactive actors
- Passivates actors that have been inactive for longer than the timeout
- Provides methods to record activity and remove actors

## 4. Circuit Breaker for External Dependencies

We implemented a circuit breaker to prevent cascading failures:

```go
// CircuitBreaker implements the circuit breaker pattern
type CircuitBreaker struct {
    name                string
    state               int32
    failureThreshold    int64
    failureCount        int64
    resetTimeout        time.Duration
    halfOpenMaxRequests int64
    halfOpenRequestCount int64
    lastStateChange     time.Time
    mu                  sync.RWMutex
    logger              logger.Logger
}
```

The circuit breaker:
- Tracks failures and transitions between closed, open, and half-open states
- Prevents requests when the circuit is open
- Allows a limited number of requests when the circuit is half-open
- Automatically resets after a timeout
- Provides detailed logging of state transitions

## 5. Enhanced Error Handling

We improved error handling throughout the codebase:

```go
// Example of using circuit breaker with repository
err := s.deviceRepoCircuitBreaker.Execute(func() error {
    var repoErr error
    dev, repoErr = s.deviceRepo.Get(ctx, deviceID)
    return repoErr
})

if err != nil {
    return errbuilder.NewErrBuilder().
        WithMsg(fmt.Sprintf("Failed to get device: %s", err.Error())).
        WithCode(errbuilder.CodeNotFound).
        WithCause(err)
}
```

The enhanced error handling:
- Uses circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
- Provides detailed error information with errbuilder
- Includes context in error messages
- Properly propagates errors through the system

## Future Improvements

While we've made significant improvements, there are still areas that could be enhanced:

1. **Supervision Strategies**: Implement proper supervision strategies for different actor types
2. **Event Sourcing**: Add persistence for actor state using event sourcing
3. **Metrics Collection**: Implement comprehensive metrics for the actor system
4. **Testing**: Increase test coverage for critical components
5. **API Compatibility**: Update the code to work with the latest version of the hollywood package

These improvements have addressed the most critical issues identified in the technical audit, particularly around concurrency safety, performance optimization, and error handling.
